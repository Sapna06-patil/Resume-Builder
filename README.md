# Resume Builder

This project aims to develop a robust and user-friendly resume builder web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The application allows users to create, manage, and customize their resumes efficiently. Key features include user registration and login, profile management, template selection, resume section management, export options, and real-time preview functionality.

Directory structure of the web app is as follows:

- backend/
- frontend/
- README.md

- Install Node JS, MongoDB in the machine.
- Start MongoDB server: `sudo service mongod start`
- Move inside backend directory: `cd backend`
- Install dependencies in backend directory: `npm install`
- Start express server: `npm start`
- Backend server will start on port 5000.
- Now go inside frontend directory: `cd ..\frontend`
- Install dependencies in frontend directory: `npm install`
- Start web app's frontend server: `npm start`
- Frontend server will start on port 3000.
- Now open `http://localhost:3000/` and proceed with loginging and creating resumes.
